I first created the equation "x = 1 + 2" in the first line.

I then looked at how 3 blind mice was formatted in the markdown file on Visual Studio Code. I entered "print(f)" to start the print line and then added tabs and new lines as needed. I also used {x} in order to display the 3 resulting from the equation. I thought line four was where the print started, so I based all my columns and tabs based on that. I created two extra tabs for each column because I thought that the lines in Visual Studio Code represented columns. I also found that the "Mice" part of the code was not a tab away from "Blind," it was more like five spaces away from "Blind" on a new line. My first result looked like this:
                3 
                         Blind 
                             Mice

I then went to Professor Rome and asked her to clarify the formatting (the layout, not "f") of the 3 blind mice homework. She redirected me to the browser version of the mice.md file, and that's when I realized there was an extra two tabs in each line. I deleted the extra tabs from each line, and it looks great now!
