# Sprint 1
### Day 1
I started my final project by watching a little under a half of [this video](https://youtu.be/GMHK-0TKRVk?si=kSbIBFjFNWH1sWbu). I followed along with the YouTuber. I learned how to open sqlite in the command prompt, create tables, insert data, and some shell commands (.tables, .save, .header). Here are some other notes I took:

    TIPS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
    Type SQL in ALL CAPS
    
    ...> means the command hasn't finished, so you should type ; to end
    
    Shell commands = all lowercase and don't need a semicolon at the end
    
    Up arrow retrieves the last line you typed. You can fix errors in single lines faster lol
