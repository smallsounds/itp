## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Neil's Food Database

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

Neil's Food Database is a program that contains a database of different foods and sorts them by traits such as texture, taste, and proximity to personal "safe" foods. It is designed to assist with ARFID treatment.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

Gabrielle McDonough (Berklee nutritionist),
[this documentation guide](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#), [this video](https://youtu.be/GMHK-0TKRVk?si=kSbIBFjFNWH1sWbu), and my roommate Christina.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will contain around 20 safe foods with tags that correlate to what makes them "safe" (texture, taste, thoughts/feelings associated). From there, I will create more food items with Gaby's help that we can incorporate into my diet. So there will be a safe food database and a new food database. I can query a safe food and new foods with similar qualities to the safe food will appear. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Safe food database (around 20 items) with 4-5 descriptors and new food database (around 15 items) with 4-5 descriptors.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Safe food database (20+ items) with 4-5 descriptors and new food database (20+ items) with 4-5 descriptors. Querying a safe food will pull up results from the new food database.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Safe food database (20+ items) with 4-5 descriptors and new food database (20+ items) with 4-5 descriptors. Querying a safe food will pull up results from the new food database. As I try new foods, I will be able to input debrief data (could my stomach process it, what did I like and not like about the food, can I change anything about the food that would make it easier to eat in the future).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

Sprint 1 (April 11) - Install SQLite and learn how to use the software. Create basic (5 items, 4 descriptors) safe food (SF) and new food (NF) databases. Meet with Gaby on Tuesday, April 16 to continue food/nutrition research.

Sprint 2 (April 18) - Integrate databases into a Python file. That will enable SF database to pull up NF database results. If time allows, continue adding items to each database. 

Sprint 3 (April 25) - Meet with Gaby to continue research and database item expansion, continue with figuring out how to connect both databases if applicable. If done with connecting databases, research how to add extraneuous information that doesn't affect the query.

Sprint 4 (May 3) - Polish program and work out any issues.
