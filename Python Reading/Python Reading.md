# Neil Small Python Reading

## Chapter 1
I knew the concepts of print statements, operators, classes, and debugging because I program a bit in C#. However, I didn't know how they were written out in Python. 

## Chapter 3
I knew the idea that variables can be named nearly anything and that tracebacks identify the line of code that has issues. In this chapter, I learned about the math module object and how to create math functions.

## Chapter 5
I knew that assignment operators go in front of relational operators. I didn't know how to create and use floor division and modulus operators.

## Chapter 10
I knew about lists and nested lists because I've used them to implement sound effects in Unity. I learned about appends and extends.
