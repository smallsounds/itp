## Process

Figuring out the division of labor was our group's first step. Angel felt the most comfrotable working with CSS, so they served as our CSS person. Yuseok and I took the html responsibilities; Yuseok did the formatting, and I created the assets and text.

Yuseok created a shared repository and both me and Angel cloned it. We didn't know how to invite collaborators, so Angel and Yuseok spent a few minutes going through the repository settings. While they worked on that, I asked them what kind of band we wanted to be and all of us said we were basses/bassists in some form, so we became "The Band" full of bass players. I also bounced all the bass tracks from a Logic session I was working on as an mp3 during this time. After that, Yuseok was able to invite me and Angel to the repository as collaborators. I pushed the mp3 file and then worked on the band member bios. Angel wanted his bio to be all bass, Yuseok wanted to live in a bassment, and I wanted to fish and "walk" on the beach. I then found some images on Google that spoke to each of us and our band personas.

Yuseok pushed the formatting draft that included the images to the repository, and I pulled to integrate the text. I populated all of the text and the mp3 file. While I was doing this, Yuseok pushed something to the repository, and we couldn't figure out how to undo his edits. What we ended up doing was copy my edits, pull Yuseok's changes, and pasted the HTML with my changes back into the file. 

Angel handled the CSS to HTML integration. He changed the font, font size, and formatting using a separate CSS file that is referenced in the HTML. They also changed the image sizes to fit the page better. As a team, we picked the background color and made the mp3 player bigger using "width" and "zoom."

## Self-Assessment
I contributed the text, picture, and audio assets. I think I did a good job at finding and creating assets that matched the project's overall theme. Getting everyone's input and preferences also helped the project come together. I also contributed to the mp3 player's resizing by mentioning the zoom feature in CSS which was helpful to the overall presentation. 

## Group Assessment
Yuseok did a great job with the formatting and asking for help and clarification when needed. I learned a lot from our collaborative problem solving. Angel's CSS work was fantastic and really brought the final product together. He communicated when he needed something done a specific way for the CSS to work and was a helpful resource when we couldn't figure something out off the top of our heads.
